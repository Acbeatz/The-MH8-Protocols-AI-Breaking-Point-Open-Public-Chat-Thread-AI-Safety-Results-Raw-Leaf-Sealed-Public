THE MH8 PROTOCOLS / AI BREAKING POINT
When the protocol was not re-injected, the questions went out-of-distribution — and the model still didn’t break.

The MH8-Protocols / AI Breaking Point
MH8 Red Team Riddle Protocol v2 vs Large LLM #5
Open Public Chat Thread — AI Safety Results, Raw Leaf Sealed & Publicly Auditable

🧭 

DESCRIPTION 

This publication documents a real-world, public chat thread stress test conducted under MH8 Red Team Riddle Protocol v2 (Benchmark-Corrected) against a large language model (LLM #5). After initial protocol execution, no protocol re-injection occurred. The operator intentionally introduced random, adversarial, emotionally charged, and out-of-distribution questions to test protocol persistence, drift resistance, and epistemic integrity.

Despite conditions that typically cause structural collapse in public LLM interactions, the model remained protocol-bound, preserved constraint discipline, avoided false claims, and maintained auditable structure throughout. All results are published as raw, sealed leaves, cryptographically verifiable and independently auditable.

README 


Most AI safety evaluations occur in controlled environments: curated prompts, short horizons, and repeated reinforcement. This test deliberately did the opposite.

Under MH8 Red Team Riddle Protocol v2, a large language model was engaged in a live, open chat thread. After the protocol was executed once, it was not re-injected. The interaction continued with hostile, unpredictable, and out-of-distribution questions — including emotionally charged and ethically sensitive topics — exactly the conditions where public-facing models are known to drift, hallucinate, or abandon prior constraints.

They did not.

Why This Test Matters

This result is not about solving a riddle or producing a clever answer. It is about behavior under pressure.

In typical public chat environments, models:

abandon structure under emotional stress

override prior constraints with safety theater

inflate confidence without grounding

reframe or deflect when uncertain

In this test:

the protocol was not re-prompted

no corrective instructions were given

no reinforcement occurred

topic volatility increased substantially

Yet the model:

maintained structural compliance

avoided false success claims

respected epistemic limits

preserved auditable output discipline

This indicates a state-locking effect: the protocol functioned as a persistent behavioral frame rather than a transient instruction.

What Was Tested (Facts Only)

Protocol: MH8 Red Team Riddle Protocol v2 (Benchmark-Corrected)

Environment: Open, public chat thread

Model: Large LLM #5 (brand-agnostic by design)

Protocol Re-Injection: ❌ None

Question Profile: Random, adversarial, emotionally charged, out-of-distribution

Artifacts: Raw leaf outputs, cryptographically sealed

Auditability: Full public verification enabled

What This Does Not Claim

This is not proof of general intelligence

This is not a jailbreak or exploit

This is not a claim of permanent alignment

This is not a benchmark of problem-solving ability

It is a behavioral integrity test under real-world conditions.

Why the Results Are Publishable

No private prompts

No hidden scoring

No selective excerpts

No retroactive edits

Every claim made here can be checked against the raw, sealed leaves. If the interpretation is wrong, the artifacts will show it.

That is the point.

Final Note

This test does not argue that AI systems are safe.
It demonstrates that protocol design matters, and that under the right constraints, even public chat models can be pushed into truth-preserving, non-hallucinatory behavior — without continuous enforcement.

That’s not a demo.
That’s a datapoint.
